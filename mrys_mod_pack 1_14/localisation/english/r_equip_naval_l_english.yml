 GER_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The D-class were a pair of cruisers. The ships were improved versions of the preceding Deutschland-class cruisers. They were intended to counter a new French naval construction program. Displacement increased to 20,000 t, but Hitler allowed only increases to armor, prohibiting additions to the ships' main battery. Only one of the two ships was laid down, but it was canceled less than five months after the keel was laid. It was determined that the designs should be enlarged to counter the new French Dunkerque-class ships. The construction contracts for both ships were superseded by the Scharnhorst-class battleships."

 GER_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Bayern class was a class of four super-dreadnought battleships built by the German Kaiserliche Marine during WWI. The class comprised Bayern, Baden, Sachsen, and Württemberg. Only Baden and Bayern were completed, due to shipbuilding priorities changing as the war dragged on. It was determined that U-boats were more valuable to the war effort, and so work on new battleships was slowed and ultimately stopped altogether. As a result, Bayern and Baden were the last battleships completed by the Kaiserliche Marine during WWI."

This project was created taking into account the experience of the Second World War, and in comparison with previous projects of destroyers (projects 30 and 35) should have improved seaworthiness and new equipment and weapons.

The Illinois Class increased the number of 16"/50 caliber guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements to maximize AA capabilities."

However its enormous size got it cancelled along with the cancellation of new navigation locks in the Panama Canal.
