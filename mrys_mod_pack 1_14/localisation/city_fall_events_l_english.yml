 city_fall_news.1.d:0 "Today, the war has reached the Emerald Isle, as the city of Dublin fell to [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops. The city faced a bombing raid before the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army entered it, and many buildings were destroyed in order to weaken the city's garrison.\n\nAfter the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army secured Dublin's surroundings, it paraded through the center near the damaged Dublin Castle, confirming [new_controller.GetNameDEF]'s control over it. Local underground resistance groups have already started operating which might prove the occupation of Ireland to be rather costly in the future."
 city_fall_news.1.a:0 "This is not the end!"
 city_fall_news.1.b:0 "Ireland's biggest city is ours!"
 city_fall_news.1.c:0 "Curious."
 city_fall_news.2.t:0 "Fall of Lisbon"
 city_fall_news.2.d:0 "Lisbon, one of the oldest cities in Europe, has recently been captured by [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops. After a fierce defense by the [old_controller.GetAdjective] army, part of the soldiers tried to retreat over the Tagus river and escape, but all of them were ultimately either captured or killed.\n\nAfter the city's capture, [new_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers paraded through the Avenida de la Liberdade, waving the [new_controller.GetAdjective] flag. This marks an important strategic victory for [new_controller.GetNameDEF], as it's now in control of Portugal's most important city and an important port on the Atlantic Ocean."
 city_fall_news.2.a:0 "Oh no..."
 city_fall_news.2.b:0 "It's ours!"
 city_fall_news.2.c:0 "So falls the heart of Portugal..."
 city_fall_news.3.t:0 "Fall of Madrid"
 city_fall_news.3.d:0 "Today marks the first time that Madrid has seen action after the end of the Spanish Civil War. The heart of Spain has fallen to the advancing [new_controller.GetAdjective] army as it captured the city after a tense urban fight. While the local population is still fighting using the methods of guerrilla warfare, the city's main points and bridges over the Manzanares river are under full control of [new_controller.GetNameDEF].\n\nWith the biggest city of Iberia in enemy hands, [old_controller.GetNameDEF]'s positions are now severely weakened, and morale in the [old_controller.GetAdjective] army is starting to fall."
 city_fall_news.3.a:0 "Very unfortunate."
 city_fall_news.3.b:0 "A great victory!"
 city_fall_news.3.c:0 "That whole '¡No pasarán!' thing didn't work out, huh?"
 city_fall_news.4.t:0 "Fall of Barcelona"
 city_fall_news.4.d:0 "Recent fighting in the city of Barcelona has once again interrupted the construction of the Sagrada Família church, as [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops faced stiff resistance by the [old_controller.GetAdjective] army during the battle for the city. However, after fighting for the hights surrounding Barcelona, the city has finally been captured and is now under the control of [new_controller.GetNameDEF].\n\nThe city's history as the centerpoint of various anarchist and leftist movements during the Spanish Civil War can still be seen, as civilians take up arms and resist the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army in brutal street-to-street fighting, which might prove the occupation of the city and Catalonia in general rather difficult."
 city_fall_news.4.a:0 "We will recover it!"
 city_fall_news.4.b:0 "The sunny beaches of Barcelona are finally ours."
 city_fall_news.4.c:0 "The 'Head and Hearth of Catalonia' has fallen..."
 city_fall_news.5.t:0 "Fall of Edinburgh"
 city_fall_news.5.d:0 "Today, the city of Edinburgh, nicknamed 'Athens of the North', was seized by [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops. After trying to envelop the city, the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army moved towards the center and captured the naval facilities at Leith, while simultaniously securing control over the city's outskirts.\n\nWhile the urban infrastructure has remained relatively undamaged, buildings like the Edinburgh City Chambers have suffered damage due to artillery shelling. The seven hills upon which the city was built are now fully under the control of [new_controller.GetNameDEF], while [old_controller.GetNameDEF] has suffered a major loss in this war."
 city_fall_news.5.a:0 "We will liberate it, eventually!"

 city_fall_news.6.t:0 "Fall of Liverpool"
 city_fall_news.6.d:0 "Today it was reported on [new_controller.GetAdjective] radio that the city of Liverpool, a major port on the Irish Sea, has been captured by the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army. This has come as a major shock and a disappointment to the leadership of [old_controller.GetNameDEF] who consider the city to be vital for their strategic interests.\n\nDue to heavy urban fighting and deliberate destruction of important objects by both sides, the Seaforth Dock has been heavily damaged. However, the Liverpool Cathedral, the largest one of its kind in all of Britain, has remained relatively untouched due to its historical significance."
 city_fall_news.6.a:0 "We will retake it!"
 city_fall_news.6.b:0 "Great!"
 city_fall_news.6.c:0 "Has [old_controller.GetNameDEF] lost the Battle for the Atlantic?"
 city_fall_news.7.t:0 "Fall of London"
 city_fall_news.7.d:0 "London, once the heart of a world-spanning empire and the global economic center, has recently fallen to [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops. The [old_controller.GetAdjective] army put up a strong defense of the city, fighting the enemy for every street, but they had to retreat at the end due to mounting losses.\n\nWith all of the main bridges over the Thames secured, all of the city except a few suburbs is now under full control of [new_controller.GetNameDEF]. This has come as a huge shock to the people of [old_controller.GetNameDEF], as they never thought that they could lose such an important city."
 city_fall_news.7.a:0 "We will never surrender!"
 city_fall_news.7.b:0 "Finally, it is ours!"
 city_fall_news.7.c:0 "Looks like [new_controller.GetNameDEF] has won the Battle of Britain..."
 city_fall_news.8.t:0 "Fall of Bordeaux"
 city_fall_news.8.d:0 "Bordeaux, known for its fascinating history and cultural significance for all of France, has fallen to [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops. While the [old_controller.GetAdjective] army mounted a strong defense, the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army advanced along the Garonne river and captured Port de la Lune, the most important point of the city.\n\nReports from Bordeaux itself indicate that most of the cultural architecture, including the Place de la Bourse and the Grand Théâtre, has suffered little to no damage. However, the city's harbor has been practically destroyed after intense battles for it, and the new [new_controller.GetAdjective] administration has already ordered local workers to repair it for future use as a naval base."
 city_fall_news.8.a:0 "Oh no..."
 city_fall_news.8.b:0 "Great!"
 city_fall_news.8.c:0 "The war is taking an unexpected turn."
 city_fall_news.9.t:0 "Fall of Marseille"
 city_fall_news.9.d:0 "The battle of Marseille has recently ended with a decisive [new_controller.GetAdjective] victory. After capturing the center of the city and its naval facilities, [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops moved to secure the suburbs and clear out pockets of enemy resistance. Before retreating, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] army managed to blow up the Marseille Transporter Bridge to slow down the [new_controller.GetAdjective] advance.\n\nTense urban warfare has left its mark on the city's infrastructure, as the Old Port of Marseille lies in complete ruins, along with the city's Old Town and other important landmarks. Nevertheless, [new_controller.GetNameDEF] is now in full control of Marseille."
 city_fall_news.9.a:0 "Unfortunate..."
 city_fall_news.9.b:0 "Great news!"
 city_fall_news.9.c:0 "A major victory for [new_controller.GetNameDEF]."
 city_fall_news.10.t:0 "Fall of Paris"
 city_fall_news.10.d:0 "After heavy fighting on the outskirts of Paris, [old_controller.GetAdjective] commanders, fearing heavy damage to its infrastructure, have declared it an open city, after which it was occupied by [new_controller.GetAdjective] focres.\n\nAs shocking parisians looked on, [new_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers victoriously marched down the Champs Élysées and Avenue Foch, and the [new_controller.GetAdjective] flag could be seen flying on the Arc de Triomphe. In a symbolic move, [new_controller.GetLeader] has already planned out a visit to [new_controller.GetAdjective]-controlled Paris with the goal of seeing the Eiffel Tower and Napoleon's tomb."
 city_fall_news.10.a:0 "How could this have happened?!"
 city_fall_news.10.b:0 "A great triumph!"
 city_fall_news.10.c:0 "The [new_controller.GetAdjective] army seems unstoppable."
 city_fall_news.11.t:0 "Fall of Luxembourg"
 city_fall_news.11.d:0 "Today, the great city of Luxembourg has fallen to [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops. After breaking through weak barricades leading to the city, the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army captured it and secured many other Luxembourgish towns.\n\nWhile the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army triumphantly marched through the center of the city in front of its shocked residents, [old_controller.GetAdjective] commanders assessed their failures."
 city_fall_news.11.a:0 "What a disaster."
 city_fall_news.11.b:0 "It was just a speed bump."
 city_fall_news.11.c:0 "Luxembourg has fallen..."
 city_fall_news.12.t:0 "[new_controller.GetAdjective] Army Advances Through Flanders"
 city_fall_news.12.d:0 "Belgium has heavily suffered during the Great War, as a lot of the fighting took place right on its territory, turning millions of soldiers into rotting corpses buried beneath the soil in Flanders. It seems that now history has repeated itself, as [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops are advancing through Flemish plains, taking major city after major city and putting places like Antwerp and Brussels on the frontline.\n\nWhile the [old_controller.GetAdjective] government has promised to defend every inch of their country's land, [old_controller.GetAdjective] troops are being pushed out of the region at a steady pace, so it's probably only a matter of time until the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army occupies it fully."
 city_fall_news.12.a:0 "Damn..."
 city_fall_news.12.b:0 "The [new_controller.GetAdjective] advance continues!"
 city_fall_news.12.c:0 "Wow."
 city_fall_news.13.t:0 "Fall of Amsterdam"
 city_fall_news.13.d:0 "Today, the 'Venice of the North' has fallen to [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops. The [old_controller.GetAdjective] army surrendered the city under the threat of bombing raids and retreated, allowing the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army to take control of it and the adjacent North Sea Canal.\n\nAmsterdam's residents report seeing [new_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers walking along the main streets of the city beside its many canals. With the main points around the city secured, it's safe to say that [new_controller.GetNameDEF] now controls an important strategic point on the coast of the North Sea."
 city_fall_news.13.a:0 "This is not the end!"
 city_fall_news.13.b:0 "Great!"
 city_fall_news.13.c:0 "An interesting development."
 city_fall_news.14.t:0 "Fall of Bern"
 city_fall_news.14.d:0 "While in the past Swiss cities didn't see fighting thanks to Switzerland's neutrality, things have now changed as the city of Bern has fallen to the advancing [new_controller.GetAdjective] army.\n\nAs [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops advanced through the Swiss Plateau, they fired many artillery shells at the city to weaken its defense, leading to the destruction of many of its sights, inclusing the medieval Zytglogge clock tower. After tense fighting, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] army retreated from the city, leaving it in the hands of [new_controller.GetNameDEF]."
 city_fall_news.14.a:0 "Get in the bunkers!"
 city_fall_news.14.b:0 "Fighting in mountains is hard."
 city_fall_news.14.c:0 "The war has come to Switzerland."
 city_fall_news.15.t:0 "Fall of Milan"
 city_fall_news.15.d:0 "Milan, the heart of Northern Italy, has recently fallen to advancing [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops. Prior to this, the city was heavily bombed to weaken its defenses, which led to a lot of its medieval infrastructure being damaged. While the Milan Cathedral stands relatively untouched, the Teatro alla Scala has been practically destroyed.\n\nControl over Milan gives [new_controller.GetNameDEF] a stretegically important point between the Alps and the Po river and easier access to both of those regions, and the war is getting increasingly less favorable for [old_controller.GetNameDEF]."
 city_fall_news.15.a:0 "Mama mia!"
 city_fall_news.15.b:0 "Great!"
 city_fall_news.15.c:0 "Interesting."
 city_fall_news.16.t:0 "Fall of Rome"
 city_fall_news.16.d:0 "After heavy battles on the outskirts of Rome, the eternal city has fallen. Once the center of an empire spanning all of the Mediterranean, it now lies under [new_controller.GetAdjective] occupation. As [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops wander around the city, viewing its ancient sights, many are surprised that that important architecture suffered little to no damage during the battle for the city.\n\n[new_controller.GetNameDEFCap] has so far respected the Vatican's neutrality and hasn't encroached on its sovereignty due to the Pope's high authority as a religious figure. This is certainly a huge setback for [old_controller.GetNameDEF] in its war against [new_controller.GetNameDEF], and many experts can't help but wonder if the rest of the Italian peninsula will fall as well."
 city_fall_news.16.a:0 "Mama mia!"
 city_fall_news.16.b:0 "Finally, Rome is ours!"
 city_fall_news.16.c:0 "The war has taken an unexpected turn."

The [new_controller.GetAdjective] military high command has confirmed that [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces withdrew from the city after losing the battle for it, allowing the [new_controller.GetAdjective] to occupy it.\n\nThe loss of such an important city has dealt a huge blow to the reputation of [old_controller.GetLeader] who promised to hold Sicily for as long as possible. With Palermo in the hands of the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army, it seems like the rest of Sicily will fall soon as well."
 city_fall_news.17.a:0 "Mama mia!"
 city_fall_news.17.b:0 "Great job, lads!"
 city_fall_news.17.c:0 "Interesting."

 city_fall_news.18.d:0 "After a brutal siege and fierce street-to-street fighting, the city of Vienna was finally taken by [new_controller.GetAdjective] focres. As the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army approached the Austrian capital, they took control of the Danube canals and then infiltrated the city center. While [old_controller.GetAdjective] troops put up a strong defense of the city, they were forced to retreat and give up control of it.\n\nMany historic sights of Vienna now stand in ruins as a consequence of heavy fighting, while the Schönbrunn palace has become the seat of a provisional [new_controller.GetAdjective] administration responsible for the occupation of the city."
 city_fall_news.18.a:0 "How did we let this happen?!"
 city_fall_news.18.b:0 "Great victory!"

 city_fall_news.19.d:0 "The recent battles in the heart of Bavaria have now ended in Munich being occupied by [new_controller.GetNameDEF]. After heavy battles for every street, [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces have finally retreated under heavy artillery shelling.\n\nThe city also faced heavy bombing before the [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces reached it, leading to a lot of damage being dealt to its infrastructure. Various buildings on the Marienplatz, such as the National Theater and the Frauenkirche, have been completely destroyed, while the New Town Hall has remained relatively untouched by the fighting."
 city_fall_news.19.a:0 "Nein! Nein! Nein!"

 city_fall_news.20.d:0 "[new_controller.GetNameDEFCap] has reported that their army has captured the North German city of Hamburg. [old_controller.GetAdjective] troops stationed in the city managed to set up defenses before [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces could reach the city, however, as it became evident later, those defenses weren't enough to stop the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army with its overwhelming superiority from taking control of the city.\n\n[new_controller.GetAdjective] forces have now secured all bridges over the Elbe close to the city center, and it seems like the tide of war is turning against [old_controller.GetNameDEF]."
 city_fall_news.20.a:0 "Oh..."

The [new_controller.GetAdjective] flag can be seen planted at the top of the Reichstag, and the city is now fully in the hands of [new_controller.GetNameDEF]."

 city_fall_news.22.d:0 "The proud Danish city of Copenhagen has recently been captured by [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops. Far from the fortifications of the 17th century built by Christian IV, defensive structures around the city broke under enemy artillery barrages, allowing [new_controller.GetAdjective] foces to break through and capture it. Locals reported seeing [new_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers victoriously marching down the main streets near Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces.\n\nWith Copenhagen secured, the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army also invaded the Flakfortet fortress off the shores of the city, securing [new_controller.GetNameDEF]'s control of the Øresund strait."

The Old Stockholm telephone tower has completely collapsed after a fire started there, while the Stockholm Palace and the Stockholm City Hall have suffered a lot of damage to their structures."

The crumbling old fortifications around the city did not save it from being overrun by [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces which broke through into the center while simultaniously capturing the Fornebu airport and the Oscarsborg Fortress.\n\nAfter a failed counterattack, Oslo has been declared an open city by the [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces, thus marking the end of the battle for the city and giving [new_controller.GetNameDEF] an opportunity to capture the rest of Oslofjord."

The fighting, as well as the preparations for the assault, have destroyed about 80% of the city.\n\nAs [old_controller.GetAdjective] war prisoners were marched on the streets in front of the Königstor, it is safe to say that the heart of East Prussia has fallen to [new_controller.GetNameDEF]."

Even though the battle for the city was relatively small in terms of scale, a good portion of its infrastructure has suffered damage from shelling by [new_controller.GetAdjective] artillery.\n\nWith the last [old_controller.GetAdjective] units having already retreated from the city, it is now fully under the control of [new_controller.GetNameDEF]."
 city_fall_news.101.a:0 "They may have won the battle, but the war isn't over!"

 city_fall_news.102.d:0 "Today, the great Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro has fallen to [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops. The battle for the city was brutal, as the [new_controller.GetAdjective] and [old_controller.GetAdjective] armies fought not only for the control of the urban settlement, but also the Guanabara Bay and territory around it. Still, [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces were gradually pushed back and it is now clear that the battle has been won by [new_controller.GetNameDEF].\n\nThe breathtaking view of Christ the Redeemer is now overshadowed by the jarring sight of military aircraft and destroyed buildings as street-to-street fighting has left its toll on Rio's infrastructure. One can say for sure that this is a huge loss for [old_controller.GetNameDEF]."
 city_fall_news.102.a:0 "This is not the end of this war!"
 city_fall_news.102.b:0 "A big win for our army!"

 city_fall_news.103.d:0 "After a battle for the Panama Canal, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] garrison has finally surrendered, leaving the canal in [new_controller.GetAdjective] hands.\n\nThe importance of this cannot be underestimated, as [new_controller.GetNameDEF] is now in full control of the passage between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. In a speech before a crowd, [new_controller.GetLeader] has declared that 'The crossroads of the Americas and the conduit between two oceans is now ours' and that 'with it, [new_controller.GetAdjective] victory in this war is all but assured'."

 city_fall_news.104.d:0 "As [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces advance deeper into Mexico, today they have fought for and successfully taken Mexico City. After entering the Valley of Mexico, they encountered [old_controller.GetAdjective] troops that set up defensive positions on the city's outskirts. The latter were swiftly defeated and forced to retreat from the city.\n\nDue to intense urban fighting, many monuments such as the Angel of Independence have collapsed. With [new_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers already securing the mountain passes on the edges of the Valley, it's now clear that the 'City of Palaces' has fallen into [new_controller.GetAdjective]."

 city_fall_news.105.d:0 "Today, the unthinkable happened: New York City has fallen to [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops after a fierce battle with [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces. While [old_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers resisted fiercely, with the battle turning into the grueling urban warfare, [new_controller.GetAdjective] spearhead units kept advancing, taking control of one borough after another.\n\nIn the end, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] army was forced to retreat, leaving the city in [new_controller.GetAdjective] hands. The skyline of New York is now filled with smoke, which overshadows the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, while [new_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers are parading on the Fifth Avenue."

 city_fall_news.106.d:0 "Today it has been reported that the city of Washington, as well as the District of Columbia, have fallen to [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops after days of brutal urban warfare. While [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces tried to halt the [new_controller.GetAdjective] advance for as long as possible, they were pushed back after their makeshift defensive structures on the Potomac River crumbled under [new_controller.GetAdjective] artillery fire.\n\nAfter securing the city, the [new_controller.GetAdjective] flag was raised over the White House in place of the [old_controller.GetAdjective] one, and a provisional occupation authority has made the building its new headqurters."

After intense fighting in the suburbs, [old_controller.GetAdjective] troops were beaten back time and time again, until they were forced to retreat from the city altogether.\n\nWith pieces of [new_controller.GetAdjective] artillery shells lying at the bottom of Lake Michigan, practically all of Chicago is now under [new_controller.GetAdjective] contrl. This is undoubtedly a major victory for [new_controller.GetNameDEF] in its war against [old_controller.GetNameDEF]."

 city_fall_news.110.d:0 "Lying on the Silk Road, Tashkent's history is rich and, being in the heart of Central Asia, it was desired by many powers throughout the ages. Today's news might be evidence of the city switching hands once again, as [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops seized it after a short battle.\n\nBeing next to the Feghana Valley, Tashkent was an important strategic goal for the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army, which tried to maneuver around the city's defenders in effort to crush them, but that turned out to be unnecessary when [old_controller.GetAdjective] troops, weakened by artillery shelling, retreated from the city, leaving it to the enemy. [new_controller.GetAdjective] control over Tashkent was confirmed when locals saw [new_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers walking around the Hazrati Imam Complex."
